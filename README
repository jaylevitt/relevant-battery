Keep your menu bar clean; who needs an icon to let you know your power cord is plugged in? Yet it IS useful to know the battery status if you're running on battery.

relevant-battery solves that problem.  Right now, it's just a script you have to run.  Soon, it'll be a nice gem with a launchd.plist.
