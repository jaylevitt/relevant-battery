Keep your menu bar clean; who needs an icon to let you know your power cord is plugged in? Yet it IS useful to know the battery status if you're running on battery.

relevant-battery solves that problem.  Right now, it's just a script you have to run.  Soon, it'll be a nice gem with a launchd.plist.

PREREQUISITES

sudo gem install plist

INSTALL

sudo cp relevant-battery /usr/local/bin
cp fm.jay.relevantbattery.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
touch ~/Library/Logs/relevant-battery.log
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/fm.jay.relevantbattery.plist
launchctl start fm.jay.relevantbattery

USAGE

It runs automatically from launchd, and will automatically relaunch at your next login.
